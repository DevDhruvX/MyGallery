## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyGallery.git
cd MyGallery

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originaluser/MyGallery.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials

# Start development server
npx expo start
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **ESLint**: Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Format code using Prettier
- **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components

### File Structure

```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.tsx     # Main component file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.test.tsx # Tests (if applicable)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts             # Export file

screens/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScreenName.tsx       # Screen component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ScreenName.test.tsx  # Screen tests

utils/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utilityName.ts       # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utilityName.test.ts  # Utility tests
```

### Component Guidelines

```tsx
// Good component structure
import React from "react";
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from "react-native";

interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onPress?: () => void;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>{title}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 16,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: "bold",
  },
});

export default MyComponent;
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use Jest and React Native Testing Library

```tsx
// Example test
import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

describe("MyComponent", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent title="Test Title" />);
    expect(getByText("Test Title")).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```
