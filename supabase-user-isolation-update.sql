-- SUPABASE USER ISOLATION UPDATE
-- Run this SQL to update your gallery_items table to support proper user data isolation
-- This adds the missing columns for soft delete and restore functionality

-- 1. ADD MISSING COLUMNS TO GALLERY_ITEMS TABLE
-- Add columns for soft delete functionality (if they don't exist)
ALTER TABLE gallery_items 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_locally_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS permanently_deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- 2. UPDATE INDEXES FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE
-- Add indexes for the new delete-related columns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_gallery_items_deleted_locally 
ON gallery_items(user_id, is_deleted_locally) 
WHERE is_deleted_locally = true;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_gallery_items_permanently_deleted 
ON gallery_items(user_id, is_permanently_deleted) 
WHERE is_permanently_deleted = true;

-- 3. VERIFY CURRENT TABLE STRUCTURE
-- Run this to check your current table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'gallery_items' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 4. VERIFY RLS POLICIES
-- Check that Row Level Security is properly configured
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'gallery_items';

-- 5. TEST USER DATA ISOLATION
-- Run these queries while logged in as different users to verify isolation
-- (Replace with actual user IDs from your auth.users table)

-- Test 1: Check if users can only see their own active items
SELECT COUNT(*) as my_active_items 
FROM gallery_items 
WHERE is_deleted_locally = false 
AND is_permanently_deleted = false;

-- Test 2: Check if users can only see their own deleted items
SELECT COUNT(*) as my_deleted_items 
FROM gallery_items 
WHERE is_deleted_locally = true 
AND is_permanently_deleted = false;

-- 6. STORAGE BUCKET VERIFICATION
-- Verify that image storage is properly isolated by user
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'gallery-images';

-- Check storage policies
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
AND policyname LIKE '%gallery%';

-- 7. PERFORMANCE CHECK
-- Verify indexes are being used efficiently
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM gallery_items 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
AND is_deleted_locally = false 
AND is_permanently_deleted = false 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- NOTES:
-- ‚úÖ Your existing RLS policy "Users can only access their own items" should handle user isolation
-- ‚úÖ The app code now properly filters by user_id in all queries
-- ‚úÖ All update/delete operations verify user ownership
-- ‚úÖ New columns support soft delete and restore functionality

-- WHAT THIS UPDATE PROVIDES:
-- üîí Complete user data isolation (each user sees only their own photos)
-- üóëÔ∏è Soft delete functionality (recycle bin)
-- ‚ôªÔ∏è Restore from recycle bin capability
-- üîÑ Backup and restore functionality
-- ‚ö° Optimized database performance with proper indexes

-- VERIFICATION STEPS:
-- 1. Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- 2. Test with multiple Google accounts
-- 3. Verify each user sees only their own photos
-- 4. Test delete/restore functionality
